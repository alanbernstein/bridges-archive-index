[The Bridges Archive](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/) is a neat collection of math art papers, with a full back catalogue. I wanted to look for any content related to Escher, so I just wanted a single-page list of all the titles and links.

- run `scrape.py` to collect the paper details
- run `generate.py` to create a webpage with all the titles and links
- run `archive.py` to download all the PDFs
